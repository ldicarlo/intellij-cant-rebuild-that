[This is not failing as expected]


Hello all!I have a problem with a projet, I can't understand why.

TL;DR: https://github.com/ldicarlo/intellij-cant-rebuild-that if you import this project in intellij, you can't "rebuild" it, but you can ./mvnw clean install it. One way to do it though is to go to Annotation processors in settings and remove all existing profiles.



And then each time you edit the pom.xml, or even just Reload all Maven Project
